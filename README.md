# biomedical instument detection
This project involves computer vision and transfer learning to detect the basic biomedical equipment as diagnostic and therapeutic. This method uses the mobilenetv2 model and was able to achieve about 90% accuracy.
the dataset consists of training and validation images. each with 2 classes namely diagnostic and therapeutic. the following devices are taken into consideration
DIAGNOSTIC-CT, ECG, EEG, EMG, MRI, PET, Xray, blood glucose sensor, blood pressure sensor, endoscopy and pulse oximeter
THEAPEUTIC- CPR device, TENS, catheter, defibrilator, dialyser, heart lung machine, oxygen concentrator, pacemaker and ventilator
